The `hectorpractice` package can be used to run Hector in an interative process with the capability of computing probabilistic outcomes of climatic variables in provided year ranges for different climate impact scenarios. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of `hectorpractice` from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ecolo-joe/hectorpractice")
```

## More information

Eventually will build this section of the readme to include detailed information about the package. I think it would be cool to include somethings like a table of function names, function capabilities, and whether they are user-facing or not. 

It might also be cool to have a figure example of a final results similar to what is presented in the Hector readme.
