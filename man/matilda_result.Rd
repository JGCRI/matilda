\description{
This is a data set representing the results of an output from
\code{\link{iterate_model}}. The data were produced by an analysis that
includes ten iterations of the Hector model. The model results include all
Hector variable outputs from the years 1745:2300.
This ensures that data being saved from the core includes the data needed to
score the Hector runs.
